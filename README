The script is used for yank lines with their line number.
You can yank lines for specific range with their line number by key map \ny
For example, the text from line 9 to 12 is like the follow:

line9
line10
line11
line12

if you specified text from line 9 to line 12 under visual mode, press `\ny'. Then if you press `p', it would paste:

  9  line9
 10  line10
 11  line11
 12  line12

If the line number is larger than 999, the format would not that tidy.
